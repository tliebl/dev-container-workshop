To ensure a smooth and productive experience during the workshop, please follow the steps below to set up your environment:

## Prerequisites:

- **Visual Studio Code**: Ensure you have the latest version of Visual Studio Code installed. [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

- **Docker**: You'll need Docker installed and running on your machine. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

- **Remote - Containers Extension for VS Code**: Install the 'Remote - Containers' extension from Microsoft. You can find this in the VS Code Extensions Marketplace or [install it directly here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

## Getting Started:

Once you have the prerequisites in place, you're ready to clone the workshop repository into a remote container:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Access the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
3. Search for "Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume..." from the list of commands.
4. Enter the Workshop Repository URL when prompted: `https://github.com/tliebl/dev-container-workshop.git`
5. Wait for VS Code to Set Up Your Environment: This process may take a few minutes. Visual Studio Code will build the dev container and clone the repository into a Docker volume.

## What to Expect:

Your development environment will be fully configured for you, including all the necessary dependencies and tools to participate in the workshop activities. This setup ensures that everyone is on the same page, regardless of individual computer configurations.

During the Workshop, we'll dive into various challenges that will require you to utilize the skills and knowledge gained from setting up and working within your dev container. Our expert-led exercises are designed to enhance your understanding and capabilities in working with containers, providing you with hands-on experience in solving real-world development scenarios.
